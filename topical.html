      <h3>QUESTION 1</h3>
      <p>do you agree with this statement? </p>
      <p>"in a world progressively relying on digital tools and information, your future professions increasingly require the responsibility and capacity to stop and think"</p>

      <h3>Answers question 1:</h3>
      <p>
        While looking at positive and negative arguments for why thinking will be important for us in our profession we have agreed with the statement.
        The reasoning for that is because, while things get more automized and digitalized the process of doing is being more efficient and that gives away valuable time that we can use to think. 
      </p>
            
      <p>
        If we take developing a product as an example, we mean that the production of this product will go faster with the digital tools, and therefore the desire for what people want this product to do and how it can be beneficial for someone is the important part.
        Another argument supports why we agree with the statement is that we have to think about the information that we receive. 
        In the same way that people sometimes attend to lie, digital tools also can give away false information, but if we never stop and think but always take in and acknowledge everything, we read it can lead people in the wrong direction.

      <!--Question 2-->
      <h3>QUESTION 2</h3>
      <p>
        "Discuss what the difference migth be between meaning and truth".
      </p>

      <h3>Answers question 2:</h3>
      <p>
        We have discussed and the group think that the main difference between "meaning" and "truth" is that a meaning or the meaning of something often comes of how you think about it or how us as people understand for example some information that is delivered, but the truth is something that is delivered to us as concrete information and it is up to us as individuals to make an opinion on if we think It is true or false.
        To exemplify the difference, we can use a person telling another person that "the door is closed".
      </p>

      <p>
        If you want to know if it is always nice to speak the truth <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-it-always-good-to-speak-the-truth" target="_self" title="Is it always good to speak the truth">go here</a>.
        When you define the meaning of this sentence you have to make up assumptions and
        thoughts to why this person wanted to tell that the" door was closed" was 
        it to help the other person or was it because he did not want the other person to drag the door.
        If we then look at the same sentence from a truth perspective, we see that the person
        reveals information that "the door is closed", it is then up to the other person to process 
        that information and either believe the second person or not believe the person and try the door.
